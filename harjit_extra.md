- two conditions for DLA: (i) large overlap between laser and electrons and
  (ii) large initial value of transverse energy $\epsilon_{\perp}$ at injection
  time $t = 0$ to overcome its rapid reduction due to plasma acceleration by
  the longitudinal bubble field
  (i) can be satified by two laser pulses
  (ii) can be satisfied by density bump or ionization injection

- two distinct groups of injected electrons: (i) high energy DLA group that
  benefits from both DLA and high LWFA (due to delayed dephasing) and (ii) low
  energy non-DLA group that experiences smaller gain from LWFA (and nothing
  from DLA)

- betatron resonance: detuning? damping? effect of angle $\delta$?

  resonance condition to be satisfied over plasma length is that
  Doppler-shifted laser frequency should match the $l$'th harmonic of the
  betatron frequency $\langle \omega_d \rangle = l \omega_{\beta} = l
  \omega_p/\sqrt{2\langle\gamma\rangle}$

  $$\langle \omega_d \rangle \equiv \omega_L(1 - \langle v_z \rangle / v_{ph})
  \simeq \omega_L \left(\frac{1 + \langle p_x^2 \rangle / m_e^2 c^2}{2\langle
  \gamma^2 \rangle} + \frac{1}{2 \gamma_{ph}^{2}}\right)$$

  $\langle \cdot \rangle$ are time-averaged quantities over the betatron
  period, $\gamma_{ph} = 1 / \sqrt{v_{ph}^2 - 1}$, $v_{ph} = 0.9985 c$

  $p_x(t=x=0) = p_0 \sin{\delta}$

  $p_z(t=x=0) = \gamma_b m_e c$ needed for trapping electrons in bubble
