The manuscript titled "Chirped Laser Pulse Controlled Acceleration in Plasma-Bubble
Regime" by H.S. Ghotra *et al.* reports increase dephasing length.

- two conditions for DLA: (i) large overlap between laser and electrons and 
  (ii) large initial value of transverse energy $\epsilon_{\perp}$ at
  injection time $t = 0$ to overcome its rapid reduction due to plasma
  acceleration by the longitudinal bubble field
  (i) can be satified by two laser pulses 
  (ii) can be satisfied by density bump or ionization injection

- DLA significantly increasing the LWFA energy gain by extending the dephasing
  length.

- two distinct groups of injected electrons: (i) high energy DLA group that
  benefits from both DLA and high LWFA (due to delayed dephasing) and (ii) low energy non-DLA group that
  experiences smaller gain from LWFA (and nothing from DLA)

- betatron resonance: detuning? damping? effect of angle $\delta$?

  resonance condition to be satisfied over plasma length is that
  Doppler-shifted laser frequency should match the $l$'th harmonic of the
  betatron frequency $\langle \omega_d \rangle = l \omega_{\beta} = l \omega_p/\sqrt{2\langle\gamma\rangle}$

  $$\langle \omega_d \rangle \equiv \omega_L(1 - \langle v_z \rangle / v_{ph}) \simeq \omega_L \left(\frac{1 + \langle p_x^2 \rangle / m_e^2 c^2}{2\langle \gamma^2 \rangle} + \frac{1}{2 \gamma_{ph}^{2}}\right)$$

  $\langle \cdot \rangle$ are time-averaged quantities over the betatron
  period, $\gamma_{ph} = 1 / \sqrt{v_{ph}^2 - 1}$, $v_{ph} = 0.9985 c$

  $p_x^2 = p_0^2 \sin^2 \delta$

- which chirp is better for this scenario and how can it be achieved
  experimentally

- what happens for the case of a superluminal phase velocity $v_c = 1.00036c$ 

- do the longitudinal fields $E_z$ and $B_z$ only appear due to the explicit
  $r$ dependence in $f(\eta)$? What is their physical effect?

- what is the dependence on the inial phase of the betatron oscillations,
  $p_x(t=0)$ and $x(t=0)$?
