The manuscript titled "Chirped Laser Pulse Controlled Acceleration in
Plasma-Bubble Regime" by H.S. Ghotra *et al.* reports on the possibility of
using a chirped laser beam to improve the properties of accelerated electrons
in a mixed DLA/LWFA scenario. In particular, the author shows that the
laser-electron dephasing can be significantly delayed, leading to increased
electron energy gains. To my knowledge, this is the first study of LWDA
acceleration using chirped beams. As a general remark, I would suggest
rewriting the manuscript to a better standard of English, while following the
sound advice from G.M. Whitesides, Advanced Materials 16, 1375 (2004).
Furthermore, I see the following issues:

1. Could you emphasize the advantage of a single chirped beam, compared to the
   proposal of Zhang, Xi et al. Phys.Rev.Lett. 114, 184801 (2015) of using two
   beams with orthogonal polarization states / different wavelengths? Would
   there be a benefit to using their setup, while chirping *both* beams?

2. Could you estimate the normalized emittance of the electron bunch, as well
   as the total charge yield? How do these quantities depend on the laser
   intensity?

3. In Zhang, Xi, et al. Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion 60, 105002 (2018),
   they conclude that their results for the charge and energy distribution of
   the accelerated electrons are critically dependent on the time delay between
   the two laser pulses. What is the equivalent critical parameter in your
   case?

4. Is there an implicit assumption made that the electrons overlap with the
   laser during the whole interaction time?

5. Which type of chirping is advantageous to use in case one is aiming for low
   charge but high energy? What about the case of high-charge, lower energy?
   How your one implement the chirping experimentally?

6. Could you include the case of a superluminal phase velocity $v_{ph} =
   1.00036c$? What are the main differences with respect to the subluminal
   case?

7. Do the longitudinal fields $E_z$ and $B_z$ only appear due to the explicit
   $r$ dependence in $f(\eta)$? What are their main physical effects?

8. What is the model sensitivity to the initial betatron oscillation conditions,
   $p_x(t=0)$ and $x(t=0)$?

9. The critical power $P_{cr}$ is the lower threshold for
   self-focusing/self-guiding the laser in the plasma, not necessarily the
   blowout regime.

10. The betatron resonance condition to be satisfied over the plasma length is
    that the Doppler-shifted laser frequency (averaged over the betatron
    period) should match the $l$'th harmonic of the betatron frequency. How do
    detuning and/or damping affect the resonance condition in your model and
    how does it depend on the angle $\delta$?

11. Why was the particular value of $\alpha = 0.00912$ chosen?

12. In order to satisfy one of the DLA conditions, it is advantageous to have a
    large initial electron transverse momentum during injection. From your
    definition, that would require a large $\delta$, which makes the
    longitudinal momentum smaller. Can it go below the limit of $p_z(t=x=0) =
    \gamma_b m_e c$ needed for trapping electrons in bubble?
